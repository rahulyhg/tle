{"name":"TLE","tagline":"NASA/NORAD Two line element set framework","body":"### Description\r\nA two-line element (TLE) is a set of two data lines listing orbital elements that describe the state (position and velocity) of an Earth-orbiting object. The TLE data representation is specific to the Simplified perturbations models (SGP, SGP4, SDP4, SGP8 and SDP8) so any algorithm using a TLE as a data source must implement one of the simplified perturbations models to correctly compute the state of an object at a time of interest.\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n```\r\nuse TLE\\Parser;\r\n\r\n$tleParser = new Parser($tleString);\r\n\r\n$tleParser->eccentricity;\r\n$tleParser->raan;\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Learn\r\nRead more about Two Element Sets on Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-line_element_set.\r\nFind current TLE data from NORAD http://www.celestrak.com/NORAD/elements/\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with TLE?
